# Beforeact

This repository is the end goal for VanillaJS education before students are introduced to React. It only implements a mechanism for building nested DOM elements with attributes. No state management... yet.

## Setup

1. Clone repo
1. Start `http-server` - or equivalent - in repo directory
1. Open the URL in the browser, et voilÃ 

## Building HTMLElement Templates

Look in the `Elements.js` file and you'll see some initial templates created for you.

```js
const div = (...props) => factory.build("div", ...props)
```

Once that is initialized, you can use the `div()` function to create an actual `<div>` [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)-based component with some attributes.

```js
const SimpleContainer = div({ id: "simpleContainer" })
```

Then you can render that component inside an existing DOM element that you put in your `index.html` file.

> index.html

```html
<body>
    <div id="content"></div>
    <script src="components/ComponentFactory.js"></script>
    <script src="components/Elements.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
```

> app.js

```js
const SimpleContainer = div({ id: "simpleContainer" })

factory.render("#content", SimpleContainer)
```

When you inspect the DOM, you will see the following structure.

```html
<div id="content">
    <div id="simpleContainer">
    </div>
</div>
```

### Adding Content

You can pass a second argument to `div()` to specify any text that you want in the element.

> app.js

```js
const SimpleContainer = div(
    { id: "simpleContainer" },
    "It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more."
)

factory.render("#content", SimpleContainer)
```

That code will generate this DOM structure.

```html
<div id="content">
    <div id="simpleContainer">
        It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more.
    </div>
</div>
```

### Nesting Components

Let's make our simple example a tad more complex. I want to create an article component that contains a `<header>` element, which itself contains an `<h1>` element. As a sibling to `<header>`, I want a `<section>` element that contains a quote.

This is the final DOM structure that I want.

```html
<article class="article">
    <header class="article__header">
        <h1>Letters from a Stoic</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="article__section">
        It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more.
    </section>
</article>
```

Given this end goal, there are four components.

1. The containing article
1. The head component
1. The h1 component
1. The section component

Let's build each one individually.

```js
const Title = h1("Letters from a Stoic")

/*
If the second argument is an HTMLElement, it will
be appended as a child of the containing element
*/
const ArticleHeader = header(
    { className: "article__header" },
    Title
)

// This component has no children
const ArticleQuote = section(
    { className: "article__section" },
    "It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more."
)

// I can specify as many children as I want
const Article = article(
    { className: "article" },
    ArticleHeader,
    ArticleQuote
)
```

Then I can render it.

```js
factory.render("#content", Article)
```

## Composing Additional Behaviors

Using the `decorate` function - which you can find in _Elements.js_ - you can add additional behavior to any component you build.

In _Highlighter.js_ you will see that invoking `Highlighter.init()` returns an object with `onmouseout` and `onmouseover` properties. You can apply this to any component where you want the background color to change when the user hovers over it.

The syntax to make something highlightable (?) looks like this.

```js
const Container = div(
    decorate.init({ class: "articleContainer" })
            .with(Highlighter.init("highlight--goldenrod"))
            .done()
)
```

How about making something clickable?

```js
const Container = div(
    decorate.init({ class: "articleContainer" })
            .with(Clickable.init(() => console.log("Hi")))
            .done()
)
```

Draggable? The `init()` method should be provided with the value of "class" or "id". It will use the `classList` property, or the `id` property to identify the component that is being dragged.

```js
const Container = div(
    decorate.init({ class: "articleContainer" })
            .with(Draggable.init("class"))
            .done()
)
```

Putting it all together looks like this. The component below is composed with the all of the decorations - highlighter, clickable, and draggable.

```js
const ArticleHeader = header(
    decorate.init({ className: "article__header", id: "articleHeader" })
            .with(Highlighter.init("highlight--goldenrod"))
            .with(Clickable.init(() => console.log("Hi")))
            .with(Draggable.init("class"))
            .done()
)
```

## Component Factory

If you look at the `ComponentFactory.js` file, you will immediately notice that I have a function argument preceded by ellipsis.

```js
function (type, attributes, ...children) {

}
```

This is the spread operator, or spread syntax. You can read a [quick reference](http://es6-features.org/#SpreadOperator), [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), or an [in-depth explanation](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/es6-magical-stuffs-spread-syntax-in-depth-afdd0118ebd0) to get up to speed.

### How it is Being Used

Using the spread operator turns all arguments after the 2nd into an iterable collection, whether nothing was passed in...

```js
//Nothing in the children argument. Only 1 parameter.
div({ className: "list" })
```

...or text content

```js
// ...children is now a string
section({ className: "title" }, "<h1>Movie Application</h1>")
```

...or an HTML element

```js
article({}, Patient)
```

...or comma-separated, sibling HTML elements

```js
article({}, Patient, MedicalHistory)
```

...or an array of elements

```js
p({ className: "list musicList"}, [Song1, Song2, Song3])
```
